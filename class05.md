# Big O Notation

The concept of Big O notation is a way to analyze and describe the efficiency of algorithms as the input size grows. It focuses on the worst-case scenario and provides an upper bound on the time or space complexity of an algorithm. The resource explains common Big O complexities like O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n^2), providing examples to illustrate each complexity. It serves as a helpful reference for students to understand and analyze algorithmic performance.

#  Linked List 

Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The resource explains the advantages of linked lists, such as efficient insertion and deletion, as well as their drawbacks, such as slower random access compared to arrays. It likely covers concepts like creating, traversing, inserting, and removing nodes in a singly linked list, providing code examples to help students grasp the implementation details.
