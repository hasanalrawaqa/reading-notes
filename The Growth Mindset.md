Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset.
```
In her TED talk, "The Power of Believing That You Can Improve," Carol Dweck discusses the concept of a growth mindset, which is the belief that one's abilities and intelligence can be developed over time through hard work and perseverance. Dweck contrasts this with a fixed mindset, which is the belief that one's abilities and intelligence are static and unchangeable. She argues that individuals with a growth mindset are more likely to embrace challenges, learn from criticism, and ultimately achieve greater success than those with a fixed mindset. Dweck provides examples from her research on the power of mindset in education, sports, and business, and encourages listeners to cultivate a growth mindset in themselves and others. She concludes that a growth mindset can not only lead to greater achievement and success, but also to a more fulfilling and enjoyable life.

Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.
```
critiques the current cultural notion of success, which he argues is based on the idea that we are all capable of achieving anything if we just work hard enough. De Botton suggests that this idea is not only untrue but also harmful, as it can lead to feelings of anxiety, inadequacy, and self-doubt. He proposes a kinder and gentler philosophy of success that acknowledges the role of luck, privilege, and other external factors in determining our life outcomes. De Botton emphasizes the importance of empathy, humility, and realistic expectations in achieving a more fulfilling and meaningful version of success.
