## Data Visualization

* Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are popular Python libraries used for data visualization, but they have different features and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:

* Matplotlib:

Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that provides a low-level interface for creating static, publication-quality visualizations.

It offers a wide range of customizable plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, pie charts, etc.

Matplotlib allows fine-grained control over plot elements like axes, labels, and legends.

It is best suited for creating basic to advanced static visualizations with precise control over every aspect of the plot.

* Seaborn:

Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating statistical visualizations.

It offers a simplified API and comes with built-in themes and color palettes that enhance the aesthetics of the plots.

Seaborn specializes in statistical data visualization, such as distribution plots, categorical plots, regression plots, etc.

It provides advanced features like automatic calculation and plotting of statistical summaries.

* Bokeh:

Bokeh is a library specifically designed for interactive and web-based visualizations.

It allows creating interactive plots, dashboards, and applications that can be deployed in web browsers.

Bokeh provides an intuitive and declarative API for building visualizations with interactivity.

It supports various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, heatmaps, etc.

Bokeh is useful when you want to create interactive visualizations that can be explored and manipulated by users.

> Matplotlib is a powerful library for creating static plots, Seaborn focuses on statistical visualizations with an emphasis on aesthetics, and Bokeh is ideal for building interactive and web-based visualizations.

In the Seaborn library, the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots are as follows:

Relational Plots:

`sns.scatterplot()`: Creates a scatter plot to show the relationship between two continuous variables.

`sns.lineplot()`: Creates a line plot to display the trend or relationship between two continuous variables over time or any ordered variable.

`sns.relplot()`: Creates a flexible relational plot that can display various types of relationships between variables using different plotting functions.

>Purpose: Relational plots are used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. They help identify patterns, trends, correlations, or clusters in the data.


Categorical Plots:

`sns.barplot()`: Creates a bar plot to show the distribution of a categorical variable using the mean, median, or another summary statistic.

`sns.countplot()`: Creates a bar plot to show the count of occurrences of each category in a categorical variable.
`sns.boxplot()`: Creates a box plot to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories.

`sns.violinplot()`: Creates a violin plot that combines a box plot and a KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plot to show the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories.

>Purpose: Categorical plots are used to visualize the distribution or comparison of data across different categories or groups. They provide insights into the distribution of data within each category and any differences or similarities between categories.


Distribution Plots:

`sns.histplot()`: Creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of a single variable.

`sns.kdeplot()`: Creates a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot to estimate the probability density function of a continuous variable.

`sns.distplot()` (deprecated): Creates a histogram with a KDE plot overlay, but it is recommended to use `sns.histplot()` and `sns.kdeplot()` separately.

>Purpose: Distribution plots are used to understand the distribution and shape of a variable. They help identify patterns, skewness, multimodality, or outliers in the data.
