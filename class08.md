# Stacks and Queues

>Stacks
* Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

* Common operations on stacks include push (add an element), pop (remove the top element), and peek (view the top element).

* Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

* Array-based implementation involves keeping track of the top index and resizing the array when needed.

* Linked list-based implementation uses a linked list where each node points to the node below it.

* Stacks are useful in scenarios that involve tracking function calls, managing recursive algorithms, undo/redo functionality, and parsing expressions.

> Queues

* Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

* Common operations on queues include enqueue (add an element), dequeue (remove the front element), and peek (view the front element).

* Queues can also be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

* Array-based implementation involves maintaining front and rear indices and resizing the array when necessary.

* Linked list-based implementation utilizes a linked list where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

* Queues are useful in scenarios involving task scheduling, resource allocation, breadth-first search, and handling asynchronous operations.
