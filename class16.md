# Serverless Functions

* Key characteristics of serverless computing:

Serverless computing is an execution model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates resources as needed. The user only needs to write and deploy the code.

It eliminates the need for provisioning and managing servers, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code.

Serverless functions are event-driven and are executed in response to triggers or events, such as an HTTP request, database update, or file upload.

Scaling is handled automatically by the cloud provider, scaling up or down based on demand.

Users are billed based on the actual usage of resources, rather than pre-provisioned capacity.

* Differences from traditional server-based architectures:

In traditional server-based architectures, developers are responsible for managing the infrastructure, including provisioning and maintaining servers.

Server-based architectures require more upfront planning and capacity provisioning to handle expected loads.

Scaling in traditional architectures typically involves manually adding or removing servers based on demand.

With serverless computing, developers can focus on writing code without worrying about server management, enabling faster development and deployment cycles.

Serverless computing offers more granular billing, as users are charged based on the number of executions and the resources consumed during those executions.

* Getting started with Vercel and deploying a serverless function:

Sign up for an account on Vercel's website (vercel.com) if you don't have one.

Install the Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) tool on your local machine using npm (Node Package Manager).

Configure your project directory and initialize it as a Vercel project using the CLI.

Write your serverless function in a file (e.g., JavaScript or TypeScript) and export it as a function.

Use the Vercel CLI to deploy your project. It will bundle your code, upload it to Vercel's infrastructure, and provide you with a unique URL for your serverless function.

Test your deployed serverless function by making requests to the provided URL.

* APIs and their usage in Python applications:

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.

APIs provide a standardized way to access and manipulate data or services provided by external systems, such as web services, databases, or libraries.

Python provides several libraries and modules to work with APIs, such as the popular requests library.

* The Requests library in Python and a basic GET request example:

The Requests library is a popular HTTP library in Python that simplifies sending HTTP requests and handling responses.

It provides a high-level API to interact with RESTful APIs and supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

Here's an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:
```python
import requests

# Send a GET request to a URL
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200 indicates success)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Access the response content
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print('Request failed with status code', response.status_code)
```

* In this example, `requests.get()` sends a GET request to the specified URL. If the response has a status code of 200 (indicating success), the response content is accessed using `.json()` and printed. Otherwise, an error message is printed with the corresponding status code.
