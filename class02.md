## Key Principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python and Their Contribution to Code Quality

The key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python are:

1. Writing tests before writing the code
2. Running tests frequently
3. Writing minimal code to pass tests.

These principles contribute to the overall quality of code by:

- Catching errors early in the development process
- Providing a safety net for future changes
- Promoting a modular and organized code structure.

By implementing TDD, developers can create higher quality and more reliable software.

## Purpose and Use Cases of the if __name__ == '__main__': Statement in Python Scripts

The `if __name__ == '__main__'` statement is used to define a section of code that will only be executed when the script is run as the main program, rather than being imported as a module into another script. 

Use cases for including this conditional in your code are:

- Including examples of how to use the module in the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block if you're writing a module that others will use
- Defining the code that will be executed when a Python script is used as a command-line tool.

## Concept of Recursion in Python

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In Python, recursion can be used to simplify the implementation of a problem that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

A recursive function typically has two parts:

- The base case: a stopping condition that determines when the recursion should stop.
- The recursive case: where the function calls itself, usually with a smaller version of the original problem.

## Difference Between Python Modules and Packages and How to Create, Import, and Use Them

A module is a single file containing Python definitions, statements, and functions, while a package is a collection of related modules.

To create a module, simply create a new Python file and define your functions, variables, and classes in it. To import a module or package into your Python program, use the import statement.

Using modules and packages in your Python programs can help you organize your code, reduce redundancy, and make it easier to maintain and reuse.
