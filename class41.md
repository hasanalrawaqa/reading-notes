### Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes:

Dynamic routes in Next.js allow you to create pages with URLs that are based on a pattern and can include parameters. These parameters are then used to render dynamic content on the page. For example, you could have a dynamic route for blog posts like `/posts/[postId]`, where `[postId]` is a placeholder for the actual post ID.

Dynamic routes are created by creating a file in the `pages` directory with the name that matches the pattern, including placeholders enclosed in brackets. When a user accesses a URL that matches the pattern, Next.js extracts the parameter values from the URL and provides them to the page component as props. This allows you to fetch data based on the parameter and render dynamic content.

Static routes, on the other hand, are traditional routes where the content of the page remains the same regardless of the URL. Static routes are created by simply creating files in the `pages` directory with the desired route structure.

### Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?

Deploying a Next.js application involves several steps:

1. **Build the Application**: Use the `next build` command to generate an optimized production build of your Next.js application. This creates a `.next` directory containing the build artifacts.

2. **Choose a Deployment Platform**: There are several deployment platforms you can use, such as Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, and more. For instance, Vercel offers seamless integration with Next.js and provides an easy deployment process.

3. **Create a Production Environment**: Set up the necessary environment variables for your production environment, such as API endpoints or authentication tokens.

4. **Deploy the Application**: Most deployment platforms provide integrations with version control systems like Git. Connect your repository to the chosen platform, configure your deployment settings, and trigger the deployment process.

5. **Monitor and Scale**: After deployment, monitor your application's performance and usage. Some platforms offer automatic scaling to handle increased traffic.

Deployment Platforms:
- Vercel: A platform specialized in hosting Next.js applications. It offers automatic deployments, domain management, and other features.
- Netlify: Supports static site hosting and has integration with Next.js. It provides features like continuous deployment and easy domain management.
- AWS Amplify: Provides a full-stack development platform with hosting capabilities. It can deploy Next.js applications along with backend services.

### How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.

Next.js can serve static files, such as images, stylesheets, and fonts, using a special directory named `public` in the root of your project. The structure of the `public` directory will mirror the URL structure when the files are served.

For example, if you have an image named `my-image.png` in the `public/images` directory, it will be accessible at `/images/my-image.png` in your application.

To reference static assets in your Next.js application, you can use the `public` directory as the root. For instance, if you want to include an image in your component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="/images/my-image.png" alt="My Image" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Keep in mind that since the assets in the `public` directory are served as static files, they won't go through the webpack or Next.js optimization process.
