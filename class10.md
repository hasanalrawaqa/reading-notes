# Dunder methods
* Also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that provide a way to define behaviors for custom classes. They are called dunder methods because they are typically surrounded by double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`).

* The purpose of dunder methods is to enable operator overloading, allow customization of object behavior, and provide a more intuitive and convenient interface for interacting with objects. By implementing specific dunder methods, you can define how objects of your custom class should behave in various contexts, such as arithmetic operations, string representation, iteration, and more.

* Here's an example of a commonly used dunder method: `__str__`. This method is used to provide a string representation of an object and is automatically called when we use the `str()` function or print an object. Here's an example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person(name='{self.name}', age={self.age})"

person = Person("Husam", 33)
print(person)  # Output: Person(name='Husam', age=33)
```

*  the `__str__` method is defined within the `Person` class. It returns a string representation of a `Person` object in a specific format. When we print the person object or use the `str()` function on it, the `__str__` method is automatically called, and the returned string is displayed.

* By defining the `__str__` method, we can control how our custom objects are represented as strings, making it easier to understand and debug them when needed.

#  Python statistics module

* The Python `statistics` module is a built-in module that provides functions for performing various statistical operations. It offers a convenient way to calculate statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and more. It is part of the Python Standard Library, so no additional installations are required to use it.

* Example:

```python
import statistics

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
mean_value = statistics.mean(data)
print(mean_value)  # Output: 6
```

* The `statistics.mean()` function calculates the arithmetic mean, also known as the average, of a given dataset. It sums up all the values and divides by the number of elements in the dataset. In this case, the mean of `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` is `6`.

* The `statistics` module provides several other functions such as `median()`, `mode()`, `stdev()`, `variance()`, and more, which allow you to perform a wide range of statistical calculations in Python.
