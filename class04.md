# Classes and Objects

Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.

An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has a state and behavior.

The state of an object is represented by its attributes, which are like variables that hold data about the object.

The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are functions that can manipulate the object's state or perform other actions.

One of the main benefits of using classes and objects is that they allow for code reuse and organization. Instead of writing the same code over and over again for each instance of an object, you can define a class once and create as many instances of that class as you need.

Another benefit is that classes and objects can model real-world systems and entities more accurately, making it easier to reason about and design software that interacts with those systems or entities.

# Recursive thinking
```
Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. A recursive function typically breaks down a problem into smaller sub-problems that are similar in nature to the original problem, and then calls itself on these sub-problems. This process continues until the sub-problems become small enough to be solved directly, and the results of these smaller sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
```

Recursive thinking is a powerful tool in programming that allows us to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This can make it easier to understand and solve problems that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to approach.

When thinking recursively, we start by breaking down the problem into a base case (the simplest version of the problem that can be solved) and a recursive case (a more complex version of the problem that can be broken down into smaller subproblems).

To solve the recursive case, we call the same function again with smaller inputs until we reach the base case. Once we have solved the base case, we can use the results to solve the original problem.

Recursive thinking can be used in a variety of programming tasks, including searching, sorting, and data manipulation. However, it is important to use it wisely and avoid infinite recursion, which can lead to crashes or other errors.

Overall, recursive thinking is a powerful and flexible technique that can help us solve complex problems in a more intuitive and manageable way.

# Pytest

```
Pytest fixtures are functions that provide a fixed baseline for your tests. They are used to set up the necessary environment and data for a test to run. Fixtures can be used to create database connections, initialize objects, or set up temporary directories, among other things. Using fixtures can help reduce the duplication of code in tests, improve test readability, and make tests more modular and maintainable.
```

pytest Fixtures and Coverage" discusses the use of pytest fixtures and coverage for testing Python code. It begins by explaining the importance of testing in software development and how pytest can be used as a testing framework.

the concept of fixtures, which are reusable objects that can be used in tests to provide a certain state or environment. how fixtures can be defined and used in pytest, and provides examples of common fixtures such as the database fixture and the temporary file fixture.

The article discusses the use of coverage for measuring code coverage during testing. It explains how to install and use coverage with pytest, and provides examples of how coverage can be used to identify areas of code that are not being tested.

The article provides some best practices for using pytest fixtures and coverage, such as keeping fixtures small and focused, using descriptive names for fixtures, and using coverage to identify untested code.
